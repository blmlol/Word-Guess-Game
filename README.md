# Word-Guess-Game

## Installation
To run the game, please download the assets folder and the index.html file and place them in the same folder.

## Description
This project is a simple word guess game with a Star Wars themed webpage and word library. It takes user input of letters and appropriately assigns correct or incorrect letter guesses to either the word being guessed or the letters wrongly guessed chart. The number of guesses is set to 5 and will decrease each time a unique wrong guess has been made. The words are randomly picked from a word library full of words hand-picked by myself and added into an array. 

## Objective
The objective of the project is to build a simple game, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do so. The main focus was on the JavaScript functionality in displaying content to the HTML elements from the JavaScript object using methods and variables and an event listener. The user input that the game takes is any pressed key, utilizing the 'onkeyup' JavaScipt event listener.
